## About the Notes
In preparation for a graduate course in probability theory, I have been preparing [scribe notes](/notes/measure_integration/general-measure-spaces/) on measure theory and integration.  The arc of the notes follows a pair of excellent measure theory lectures from a quantum theory lecture series by [Dr. Frederic Schuller](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/frederic-schuller). 

Throughout I use notation more like that employed by [Dr. Davar Khoshnevisan](http://www.math.utah.edu/~davar/) in his [lecture notes](http://www.math.utah.edu/~davar/lecture-notes.html) on probability, which are proving useful to me.  I will be adding in some of the proofs omitted from Dr. Schuller's lectures, as incidentally, I have encountered several of them as excercises while working through the preliminary chapters of Dr. Khoshnevisan's notes.  

Transcribing these notes has helped me internalize the material, and they are presented here as a tribute to Dr. Schuller's lectures. I hope they will be useful to other students who, like me, wish to have the content accessible in written form for faster review or reference while working on other mathematics.
