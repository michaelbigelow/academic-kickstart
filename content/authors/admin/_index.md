As I complete my Master of Science and Technology in data science at the University of Utah, I am becoming skilled in mathematical/statistical modeling, machine learning, and data mining, from theory to implementation using both Python and R.
In addition to the MST, I am completing the Big Data Certificate through the U of U School of Computing. 

I am currently working with Intermountain Healthcare's data science team to build a model identifying patients at above-average risk of adverse health outcomes given their disease profile, in order to mitigate those risks and improve patient care.
