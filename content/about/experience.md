  Completed master's project consisting of a Shiny webapp interface for drilling engineers to optimize rate of penetration through diverse lithologic formations in the Vermillion Basin of Wyoming by tuning drill rig parameters.  The twofold approach first used Gaussian mixture model-based clustering similar to Kristjansson et al. to find historically optimal rig control parameters, then applied allowed the drilling engineer to adjust drilling parameter slider bars away from the historic optimum and view a plot of a random forest-predicted changes in rate of penetration to further improve drilling speed.
