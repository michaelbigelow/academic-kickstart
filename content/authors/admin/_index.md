In the final year of the Master of Science and Technology in Data Science at the University of Utah, I am working to master mathematical/statistical modeling, machine learning, and data mining, from theory to implementation. I am becoming equally proficient in both Python and R, and further developing the SQL skills and database understanding I gained as a data architect intern at Intermountain Healthcare. In addition to the MST, I am completing the Big Data Certificate through the U of U School of Computing.
